//Scrabble bot:
//
//Constraints:
//1. Given letters
//2. Dictionary
//3. Space

// Goals:
// Has to dispense out words that can be created with given letters and within a determined, confined space. Doesn't need to be fast nor resourceful.

//Pre steps:
// Vet the dictionary, sort words by length and throw out words longer than 15 letters long. DONE

//Steps:
//1. Throw out words that are longer than the space given or amount of letters given DONE
//2. For through dictionary
//3. Check if the word is made of the given letters
//4. Return a list of words that from the dictionary that were made out of the given letters and fitted in the confined space

//How to check if a word is made of letters:
//1. Sort the given list and assign the number of times a given letter, on a seperate function
//2.
